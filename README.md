A stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain either bursts or is blocked, stopping blood flow to the brain. This causes the cells to die and can lead to severe symptoms of brain damage including death. Due to the severity of a stroke, being able to accurately predict the likelihood of someone having a stroke can save several lives. The purpose of this research is to compare the current traditional approaches with a novel approach called Kappa. By using a combination of f1 scores and a weighted accuracy metric to compare Kappa with the traditional approaches, we can find what will be the most accurate prediction algorithm to use for stroke prediction. The f1 score is the standard accuracy metric found by using the precision and recall scores. The weighted accuracy metric was used to place different levels of impact with false positives and false negatives.

These files are all the experimentation files used in the Kappa project. Visualisations of the dataset and the results are found in Kappa Project Visualizations.ipynb

kappa_comp_best is the notebook we used to reach 8th place in the kaggle competition.

The Final copies notebooks are the experiments with different algorithms we did including normal, smote and undersampling

Lastly presentation slides are available.
